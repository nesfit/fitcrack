Job Bins

Bins allow you to create your own job lists and add or remove jobs from them at will. This functionality is baked into the navigation bar's Jobs tab.


Bin management
--------------

To create, move, edit and delete bins, you need to have the global editing permission. Create a bin using the 'New' button in the Job Bins header. Provide a name and confirm with the tick button or press enter.

Adding jobs
-----------

When you select jobs in the table using the checkboxes, The bin icons will change to a plus (or minus for the bin you are in for removing the selected jobs) and allow you to add the selected jobs to any of the bins by clicking on it.
