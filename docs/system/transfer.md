Data Transfer
=============

You can export jobs you select from any job listing (via the _Add to Export_ button in the selection toolbar) to a single, portable file. This can then be imported to other Fitcrack installations or serve as backup. The exports don't carry cracking assets such as dictionaries and PCFG grammars, so you'll need to add those manually before importing. The import interface will inform you if any are missing.
